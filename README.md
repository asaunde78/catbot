# catbot
a little kitty

This discord bot is designed to just have fun and mess around with the discordpy capabilities. It's a bit of a learning experience as well as a fun thing to play around with, while practicing good techniques. 

## Structure

The bot is designed around a main catbot.py and various cogs that grant catbot its functions.
- kittyleague: A cog that utilizes a custom "League of Legends API," kittyleague is able to generate all sorts of fun league releated functions.
- chronocat: A cog with the express purpose of sending good morning messages to the users of the server.
- chatcat: A cog that makes calls to the HuggingFace API to respond in a semi-natural way to users on the server.
- plainkitty: A cog that provides very basic catbot functions such as gifs, reactions, and 'csay.'
